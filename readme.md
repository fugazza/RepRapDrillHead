RepRap Drill Head
=================

This drilling head will turn your RepRap into drilling machine. Naturally RepRap will never drill huge bores. But this head is perfect (and intended) for drilling small holes into printed circuit boards (PCB).

Designed to be used with [Bionic AD-19 hobby mini-drill](http://www.evselectro.com/bionic-mini-electric-drill-and-grinder-ad-19-3606 "Bionic AD-19").
